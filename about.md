Hello there, thank you so much for visiting my blog!

**Digital Signal Processing**, **Machine learning** ,  and **Non Linear Dynamics**, I practically breathe all of it. 
I have casually blogged before on the Blogger platform back in the days of high school and made ocaasional [posts](https://www.facebook.com/me.harsh.joshi/notes) on Facebook. Nothing technical, just the usual coming-of-age rantings but this blog is not about that. Its about what I live and breath - **A.I.**

In the real world, people have been calling me with the short name "**Harsh**" which in Hindi (my native language) means "**Happiness**". I currently finished my undergraduate in B.Tech Electronics and Communication Engineering and submitted a [kickass thesis](https://ProjectNetra.github.io) for graduation. A more detailed look at my professional skills and experiences can be found on [LinkedIn](https://in.linkedin.com/in/harshjoshiprofile) or you may have a look at [my online resume here](http://Joshi-Harsh.github.io/resume/). You can also follow me on [Quora](https://www.quora.com/Harsh-Joshi-2). Founded an amazing team [Twiddlenut](https://www.TwiddleNut.com) on campus during my bachelors study, we are the crazy ones, or I hope we are. Anyways now that I have graduated, I sort of miss them. Not that we are out of touch :P 

This website (weblog/blog) is a place to share my thoughts, ideas, projects and findings. It's built with the excellent [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and proudly hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com). If you found any mistake, grammatical error or bug on this site or in the blog post, please [report here](https://github.com/Joshi-Harsh/Joshi-Harsh.github.io/issues). I am new at this stuff, it's a great learning experience for me building, deploying and maintaining this blog.

**P/S:** For any chit-chat, please ping me on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/me.harsh.joshi). Yeah! I am one of those...
